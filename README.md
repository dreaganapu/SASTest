There are two rows that duplicate all of the fields in them, except for the unique id.  One row exists in the first dataset, and the other in dataset2.  The exercise is:
 
I ask that you create a SAS program that will in-file both the data sets, format the variables, and then find the single duplicated row that exists in both data sets.  

You will need access to SAS to do the exercise.  SAS provides a downloadable version of its software at:  https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition/download-software.html

You should be able to get it running in a virtual machine on just about any computer:  http://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/main.htm.
